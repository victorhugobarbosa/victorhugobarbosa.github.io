        Black holes are regions in space where an enormous amount of mass is packed into a tiny volume. This creates a
        gravitational pull so strong that not even light can escape. They are created when giant stars collapse, and
        perhaps by other methods that are still unknown.

        Black holes fascinate both the public and scientists—they push the limits of our understanding about matter,
        space and time.

        Scientists at the University of Chicago and across the world have made many discoveries about our universe with
        the help of black holes, but there’s a lot we still don’t know about these extraordinary cosmic phenomena.

    <p>
        <strong>What is a black hole?</strong>
        Black holes are made of matter packed so tightly that gravity overwhelms all other forces.

        When you pick up a bowling ball, it’s heavy because the matter is densely packed. If you packed more and more
        mass into the same tiny space, eventually it would create gravity so strong that it would exert a significant
        pull on passing rays of light.

    <p>
        Black holes are created when massive stars collapse at the end of their lives (and perhaps under other
        circumstances that we don’t know about yet). One of the first steps toward the discovery of black holes was made
        by University of Chicago professor Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, when he realized that massive stars would have to
        collapse after they ran out of fuel for the fusion reactions which keep them hot and bright.

        The universe is full of black holes. In the past decade, scientists have detected the signals of their
        collisions and taken images of the light from the gas swirling around them—and this has helped us learn many
        things about the universe. For example, black holes have helped us test Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
        which describes how mass, space, and time are related to one another. Scientists think they can tell us much
        more about these and other essential rules of the universe.

        And on a more personal level, the supermassive black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy may have
        played a role in how Earth came to be here!

    <p>
        <strong>What do black holes look like?</strong>
        Black holes themselves are invisible—they emit virtually no light and so cannot be seen directly. But we have
        developed several ways to find them anyway.

        By looking for the stuff that’s falling in. If material is falling into a black hole, it travels at such high
        speeds that it gets hot and glows very brightly, and we can detect that. (That’s how the Event Horizon Telescope
        took its famous first images of black holes.) Scientists hope to use this method to learn a lot more about how
        and what black holes “eat.”

        By seeing their gravity pulling on other things. We can find black holes by watching the movements of visible
        objects around them. For example, a black hole’s gravity is so strong that nearby stars will orbit around them,
        so we can look for stars behaving strangely around a patch of “empty” space. From this, we can calculate exactly
        how heavy that black hole must be. That’s how Nobel Prize winner Andrea Ghez and her team detected the
        supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy.

        By detecting the gravitational ripples when they collide. We can also detect black holes by detecting the
        ripples in space-time created when two of them crash into each other. From that signal, we can tell how massive
        the black holes were, how far away they were, and how fast they were traveling when they collided.

    <strong><a name="fun_fact">What’s</a> inside a black hole?</strong>
    The short answer is that no one knows!

    “In some ways that’s one of the most profound questions in physics,” said University of Chicago Prof. Daniel Holz.
    “There are not many cases in physics where we simply cannot predict what happens, but this is one of them.”

    Black holes have two parts. There is the event horizon, which you can think of as the surface, though it’s simply
    the point where the gravity gets too strong for anything to escape. And then, at the center, is the singularity.
    That’s the word we use to describe a point that is infinitely small and infinitely dense.

    We have a good understanding of what the event horizon looks like, thanks to the laws of general relativity. But as
    you get close to the singularity itself, we lose the ability to even predict what it looks like.

    “Very near the singularity, one would expect quantum effects to become important. However, we don't yet have a
    quantum theory of gravity (or, at least, one capable of reliably making such predictions), so we just don't know the
    correct description of the singularity—or even whether it really is a singularity,” said University of Chicago Prof.
    Robert Wald.

    Scientists think that black holes eventually will explode, but it will take many, many times longer than the current
    age of the universe for that to happen. What will it look like when that happens? That’s another big mystery.

    “Maybe there’s a little nugget left behind containing all of the information that fell into the black hole, maybe
    there’s a portal to a new universe, maybe the information is just gone forever; we simply don’t know,” said Holz.

    (If all of this is unsatisfying, know that it keeps scientists awake at night, too.)
    </p>

    <strong name="fun_fact">How do black holes form?</strong>
    Scientists know about one way that black holes form, but there may be others.

    One way to make a black hole is to have a massive star collapse at the end of its life. Prof. Subrahmanyan
    Chandrasekhar was the first to calculate that when a massive star burns up all its fuel, it will collapse. The idea
    was ridiculed at first, but other scientists calculated that the star continues forever to fall inward toward its
    center—thus creating what we called a black hole.

    Black holes can grow more massive over time as they “eat” gas, stars, planets and even other black holes!

    There’s another type of black hole called a supermassive black hole. These are way too massive to have been created
    by one star collapsing; it’s still a mystery how they form. Black holes can eat other black holes, so it’s possible
    that the supermassive ones are made of many small black holes merged together. “Or perhaps these big black holes
    were especially hungry, and ate so much of their surroundings that they grew to enormous size,” said Prof. Holz. But
    we can see these supermassive black holes formed very early on in the universe—maybe too early to have been made by
    stars getting old enough to collapse—so it’s possible there’s some other way to make a black hole that we don’t know
    about yet.
